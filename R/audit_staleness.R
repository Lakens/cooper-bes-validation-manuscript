# Flags manual audit rows whose explanatory comment may no longer match
# metacheck's current behaviour.
#
# code/03_comparing_results/manual_repo_findability_audit.csv and
# manual_fair_api_findability_audit.csv contain free-text prose written by
# reading metacheck's output for one specific paper and explaining why it
# behaved that way (e.g. "peek_zips defaults to FALSE in data_check()").
# That explanation is only correct for the metacheck version installed at
# the time it was written, but targets has no way to see a version
# dependency hidden inside English prose -- it can only track the CSV file
# itself, not what install of metacheck it describes. A metacheck update
# can silently make an old row's reasoning wrong (as happened with the
# Morford et al. paper's peek_zips explanation after metacheck's own
# default changed) with nothing in the pipeline flagging it.
#
# Each row records, in metacheck_version, the installed metacheck RemoteSha
# at the time the row was last written, and in version_is_exact, whether
# that SHA was actually captured (TRUE) or merely inferred from the git
# commit date of the row itself (FALSE, for rows written before this
# tracking existed). This target reruns whenever either audit CSV changes
# or the installed metacheck package changes, and returns the rows that
# predate the currently installed version -- a worklist of rows to
# re-verify, not an error to fix automatically, since only a human
# re-reading the paper can confirm whether the old explanation still holds.
