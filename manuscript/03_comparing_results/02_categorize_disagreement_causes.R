# Categorizes each reviewed disagreement's verdict comment into a small,
# reproducible set of root-cause buckets, by keyword pattern over the
# comment text -- so the manuscript's qualitative "N of M disagreements
# were caused by X" prose is computed from the actual review comments,
# not hand-counted or hand-typed. A comment is assigned to the FIRST
# bucket (in priority order below) whose pattern it matches; anything
# matching none of them falls into "other" rather than being forced into
# a bucket it doesn't clearly belong to.

# This is a copy of cooper_validation_metacheck/manuscript/
# code_data_preparation/58_categorize_disagreement_causes.R, relocated
# here with its own input so this stage of the pipeline is
# self-contained; only the file paths were changed (all now relative to
# this folder instead of data/), the source()'d helpers.R dependency was
# replaced with an inline status() (this script uses no other helper),
# and this header comment.
#
# Usage (from inside manuscript/): Rscript 03_comparing_results/02_categorize_disagreement_causes.R
