# Cooper et al.'s raw CSV (BES-data-code-hackathon-cleaned) contains a
# handful of byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 (a garbled accented
# author name or en-dash in a few free-text cells). read.csv()'s default
# fileEncoding reads these as a few extra garbled characters rather than
# failing outright, but the resulting string is not valid UTF-8, and any
# later code that calls nchar()/View() on it throws "invalid multibyte
# string". Forcing fileEncoding = "UTF-8" is not a safe fix instead --
# R's scan()-based reader aborts entirely at the first invalid byte. This
# repairs only the specific invalid byte sequences, in place, leaving
# every valid character untouched.
